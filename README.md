# ReactShop

This is demo shop based on React.js as frontend, and Express + MongoDB as backend.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles frontend part of app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
